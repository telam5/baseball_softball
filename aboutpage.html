	<p> We decided to do our project on softball and baseball as we are both passionate about the subject. We have played the sport for as long as we can remember, and have chosen to play at the collegiate level as well. Our passion and drive for the game, as well as our knowledge of the sport, helped us to write these pages explaining the process of each respective piece of the game.</p> 

	<p>We will be providing basic information about baseball and softball. This information is just the beginning of comparing the sports similarities and differences. We both have played these sports since we were younger. So, we're going based on the surface information to inform you on the basic knowledge of the sports. This information won't educate you on how to play the sport but will go into some detail about how they compare to one another. While doing so, we will be comparing the differences between both sports.</p>
